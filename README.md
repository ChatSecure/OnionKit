# [OnionKit](https://github.com/chatsecure/onionkit)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ChatSecure/OnionKit.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ChatSecure/OnionKit)

For low level Tor support on iOS (and a thin Objective-C wrapper), check out [CPAProxy](https://github.com/ursachec/CPAProxy) instead. We have directed our efforts toward improving CPAProxy instead of maintaining OnionKit in its current form. 

We eventually plan to add higher-level UI features like a hardened WKWebView and bridge editor to OnionKit, with a dependency on CPAProxy.
